# Webapp SDK
WebApp SDK enables the third party users to develop a high quality of WebEx meeting client and rich feature tool with minor efforts. The main features include such as multiple-party of audio, video and content sharing conferencing, group in-meeting chat, WebRTC-powered tools etc. WebApp SDK APIs written in Javascript offers a wide range of features to fascinate a variety of services. The APIs communicate with the powerful WebEx back-end platforms to remove the burden of the communication complexity between clients and servers. With the SDK, the developers can focus on the UX development without worrying the service implementation.

# SDK APIs
The APIs are given in doc/sdkApi.js. Not all of APIs have been implemented yet and we are in progress to develop the features.
